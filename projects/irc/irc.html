              <h1>Introduction</h1>
              <p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. You can think of it as a chatting system where you have so many chatting rooms to choose from.</p>
              <p>An IRC client is a program that lets users connect to IRC. There are some IRC web clients like QwebIRC and KiwiIRC as well as some clients that you can install like HexChat, mIRC and irssi.</p>
              <p>There are many IRC servers that you can connect to like Freenode, which is the most popular one and the one you should always connect to. Each server has its own IRC channels (some servers have the same channels).</p>
              <p>In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of using the IRC. You will be using QwebIRC for now and if you feel like you want to switch to KiwiIRC or install an IRC client, you can do that.</p>
              <p>Content:</p>

                <li>How to Connect to the Server</li>
                <li>Simple Concepts</li>
                <li>Useful Commands</li>
                <li>Tips and Advice</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="item carousel-space">
              <h1>How to Connect to the Server</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>Type in the nickname that you want to be known as in the Nickname text field. Your nickname should represent yourself so that users can recognise you.</li>
                <li>Type in the channel names that you want to join after connecting to the server in the Channels text field. This is optional, meaning that you can leave it empty if you do not want to join any channel after connecting. If you want to join multiple channels at once, just separate the channel names with a comma. Channels have to start with at least 1 hashtag.</li>
                <li>If you do not have a NickServ account, then skip this step, otherwise check the "Auth to services" checkbox and type in your username and your password.</li>
                <li>The reCAPTCHA is only used to make sure that the user is a human and not a robot. This is useful to prevent spam and abuse. Just do what the it says, it will only take a few seconds.</li>
                <li>Click on the "Connect" button to connect to the server and if you see an error message, you might want to fix something and try again.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="item carousel-space">
              <h1>Simple Concepts</h1>
              <p>Take a look at <a href="irc-interface.png">this image</a>, it names and describes some of the parts of the client.<br>Here are some useful things that you should know about:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If you want to get someone's attention, just mention their nickname, they will receive a notification and be able to read your message.</li>
                <li>Do not add a "+" or an "@" at the beginning of the operator or the voiced user that you want to highlight.</li>
                <li>The best way to mention someone's nickname is by typing the first few letters of their nickname and pressing the tab key to auto-complete it.</li>
                <li>Not all channels have their moderators operated and the trusted users voiced.</li>
                <li>Channel names and nicknames are case-insensitive.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="item carousel-space">
              <h1>Useful Commands</h1>
              <p>Commands start with a "/" and are case-insensitive. You do not have to memorise all of them, but you should know these:</p>
