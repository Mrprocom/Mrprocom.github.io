      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Moderators may interpret these rules differently depending on each situation and common sense. Even if something is not directly listed in these rules, that does not mean you can get away with it.</p>
      <p>Read all of the rules about the activity you want to do before doing anything else. You are responsible for your account and ignorance is not an excuse.</p>

        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Try to use proper grammar.</b> English is the official community language, but use is not required in regional or cultural groups. If you cannot write English well, we advise that you use <a href="https://translate.google.com/" target="_top">Google Translate</a>.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not spam.</b> There's not a one size fits all definition here, but the idea is usually obvious. In addition, the following are seen as spam and may be hidden or deleted:<ol>
            <li>Posting multiple threads on the same subject. Try to combine threads on game feedback or suggestions into one thread.</li>
            <li>Bumping an old thread by replying. This is what we call 'necro' or 'necroing'. The content of the thread may be stale (fixing issues, ideas, etc). We recommend posting a new thread for an updated or more current response.</li>
            <li>Posting on a thread with '+1' or other short replies. There's no need to constantly bump a thread and make finding replies difficult. Replies are great for constructive feedback, while the '+1' button is to show your support for the content.</li>
            <li>Comments that are excessively long or gibberish. Making comments such as repeating the same letter or have little to no intended purpose, fall under this rule. Comments that are in a different language are exempt.</li>
            <li>Excessive formatting. UPPERCASE, Bold, and italics can be nice with moderate use, but please do not use them throughout the entire post.</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Keep swearing to a minimum.</b> Comments or saves containing swearing are at risk of being deleted. This also includes swearing in other languages.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Refrain from uploading sexually explicit, offensive, or other inappropriate materials.</b><ol>
            <li>These include, but are not limited to: sex, drugs, racism, excessive politics, or anything that offends or insults a group of people.</li>
            <li>Reference to these topics in other languages is also prohibited. Do not attempt to bypass this rule.</li>
            <li>Posting URLs or images that violate this rule is prohibited. This includes links or text in your profile information.</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not advertise third-party games, sites, or other places not related to The Powder Toy.</b><ol>
            <li>Mainly this rule is intended to prevent people going through and advertising their own games and products.</li>
            <li>Unauthorized or unofficial community gathering places, such as Discord, are prohibited.</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Trolling is not allowed.</b> As with some rules, there's no clear definition. Users who repeatedly troll are far more likely to be banned and recieve longer bans than others.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not impersonate anyone.</b> Registering accounts with names intentionally similar to other users in our community or other online communities is prohibited.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post about moderator decisions or issues.</b> If there is a problem regarding a ban on your account or content removal, please contact a moderator through the messages system. Otherwise, discussion about moderator actions should be avoided.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Avoid backseat moderating.</b> Moderators are the ones who make the decisions. Users should refrain from threatening bans or possible results from breaking a rule. If there is a possible issue or you are unsure, we recommend reporting the issue through the 'Report' button or via the messaging system on the website.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Condoning of breaking common laws is prohibited.</b> The jurisdiction of which country's laws applies is not clear, but there are some common ones to know. These include, but not limited to:<ol>
            <li>Piracy of software, music, bagels, etc.</li>
            <li>Hacking / Stealing accounts</li>
            <li>Theft / Fraud</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not stalk or harass any user.</b> This has been a growing problem in recent years by different methods, but generally these include:<ol>
            <li>'Doxing' user(s) to find where they live or their real identity</li>
            <li>Constantly messaging a user when they wish to refrain from any contact</li>
            <li>Mass downvoting saves</li>
            <li>Posting rude or unnecessary comments on someone's content (saves, forum threads, etc)</li>
            <li>Coercing a group of users to 'target' a user</li>
            <li>Personal arguments or hatred. This could be arguing in the comments or making hate saves</li>
            <li>Discrimination, in general, of people. This could be religious, ethnic, etc.</li></ol>
          </li>

      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Don't claim other people's work.</b> If you have to use a program to draw out pixels from an image outside of Powder Toy without drawing it by hand, then do not be surprised when the save gets deleted and you get banned. Jojobond has his on the topmost votes because he was the first to figure out how, but the grandfather rule no longer applies.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Self-voting or vote fraud is not allowed.</b> This is defined as making multiple accounts to vote on your own saves or the saves of others. We enforce this rule strictly, therefore, you must understand that there are very few successful ban appeals. Please ensure you and other accounts are not voting from the same household. All alternate accounts will be permanently banned, the main account will be temporarily banned and any affected saves will be disabaled.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Asking for votes of any kind is frowned upon.</b> Saves which do this will be unpublished until the issue is fixed. Examples of such that are under this rules are:<ol>
            <li>Signs that may hint at voting up or down. The signature green arrow or asking for votes goes under this rule.</li>
            <li>Gimmicks that ask for votes. These might be a total number of votes in exchange for something, like '100 votes and I'll make a better version'. This is what we define as vote farming. Any type of vote farming is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Asking for votes in return for usage of a save or for any other reason is prohibited.</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not spam.</b> As mentioned earlier, there are no standards for what counts as spam. Here are some examples that may qualify as spamming:<ol>
            <li>Uploading or re-uploading saves within a short amount of time. Don't try to circumvent the system to have your saves seen/voted by people. This includes uploading 'junk' or 'blank' saves with little to no purpose. These saves will be unpublished.</li>
            <li>Uploading text-only saves. These may be announcements or looking for help of sorts. We have the forums and comments area available for many purposes these text-only saves would serve. These saves will be removed from front page.</li>
            <li>Uploading art saves is not strictly prohibited, but may result in a front-page demotion. We like to see usage of the variety of elements in a creative manner. Lack of these factors (such as in deco-only saves) will typically result in a front-page demotion</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Refrain from uploading sexually explicit or other inappropriate materials.</b> These saves will be deleted and will lead to a ban.<ol>
            <li>These include, but are not limited to: sex, drugs, racism, excessive politics, or anything that offends or insults a group of people.</li>
            <li>Don't try to circumvent this rule. Anything that intentionally refers to these concepts/ideas by direct or indirect means falls under this rule.</li>
            <li>Reference to these topics in other languages is also prohibited. Do not attempt to bypass this rule.</li>
            <li>Posting URLs or images that violate this rule is prohibited. This includes links or text in your profile information.</ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Image plotting is strictly prohibited.</b> This includes usage of scripting or any third-party tools to plot or create a save for you. Saves using CGI will be deleted and you may receive a ban. However, there is an exception which has strict guidelines:<ol>
            <li>The save demonstrates the game's physics or demonstrates functionality of a save. The focus of the save should not be the result of the script. Decoration creation or modification by a script is not allowed, as this tends to be a focal point of saves for users</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Keep logos and signs to a minimum.</b> These saves may be removed from front page. Items that this rule restricts are:<ol>
            <li>Excessive logos placed</li>
            <li>Signs without intended purpose</li>
            <li>Fake update or notifications signs</li>
            <li>Linking other saves that have no related purposes</li></ol></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not place offtopic or inappropriate tags.</b> Tags are only there to improve search results. They should generally only be one word descriptions of the save. Sentences or subjective tags may be deleted. Inappropriate or offensive tags will likely get you banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Intentional lag inducing or crashing saves are prohibited.</b> If the majority of users are writing about the save causing crashes or lag, then the save will fall under this rule. These saves will be removed from front page or disabled.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not misuse the reporting system.</b> Sending in report reasons such as 'bad save' or gibberish wastes our time. Unless the issue pertains to a possible rule violation or community issue, please refrain from sending a report. If you think the save violates or poses a community issue, send a report anyway! Bans will never happen if you are reporting a save in good faith.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not ask for saves to be demoted or removed from the front-page.</b> Unless the save violates any rules, it will stay on the front-page. There is no exception to this rule for art saves, please do not report art either.</li>

          <li class="text-muted"><b>Use common sense.</b> If it seems against the rules (trolling, spam, harassment, etc), it probably is, even if it is not listed here.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not flood or spam.</b> Pasting more than 4 lines of text at once is considered spam (consider using pastebin).</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post random quotes from other channels or websites</b>, unless it relates to the conversation. This can be seen as spam since nobody understands the context.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Please use legible English.</b> Purposely bad grammar, incorrect spelling, and slurs are highly annoying and will get you quickly banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not highlight random people for no reason</b>, or mass highlight the entire channel.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>#powder's only bot is PowderBot</b>, other bots are not allowed here and will be instantly banned. Bots can be brought to ##powder-bots instead. Do not use scripts without approval either, if you don't disable them you may be banned from the channel until you do.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not abuse or spam the bot</b>. Using the bot for excessive spam is against the rules and you will be given a channel ignore from the bot. Use the bot in PM instead, /query PowderBot.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not abuse caps lock or formatting characters.</b> These include colors, bold, underlines and right-to-left overrides.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post links to anything of illegal nature.</b> Shock and screamer sites are also banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post links to NSFW content or have explicit sexual discussions.</b> Excessive NSFW content is bannable, please use #powder-social when you can instead.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not complain about bans in channel.</b> If you need to resolve a ban, try querying the mod that placed it. Bans usually have expiration times but if you query the mod that placed it you might be able to get it removed quicker. If you complain and argue constantly over a ban in other channels, you might find yourself banned in those channels too.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Be nice to newbies.</b> Don't demand info like age, location (geoip), or tpt account, and don't troll or trick them into doing things.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not publicly log #powder or relay it to other channels without permission.</b> People do not expect what they are saying to be relayed to people they cannot see in other channels. There are currently official logs at <a href="http://mniip.com/irc/log/" target="_top" rel="nofollow" class="shift-click">mniip's Logs Page</a> though.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not rapidly change nicks.</b> Do not use nicks that encourage spam or trolling either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not impersonate other users from IRC or the forum.</b> Do not register other users' nicknames either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not talk about breaking other channel's rules.</b> We do not condone trolling or breaking rules in other channels</li>

      <h3 id="reporting" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#reporting" target="_top">Save Reporting Rules</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <p>Report a save for breaking any of the save uploading rules, it is not just for inappropriate saves and stolen saves. You may also report a save for the comments or tags on it, even if it is your own. This is the easiest way to notify a moderator of something they may need to delete. We can also see who creates tags, so if there is a large amount of tag spam, reporting may be better than deleting the tags yourself, losing the data of who made them.</p>
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not misuse reports.</b> It wastes moderators' time and may lead to saves wrongfully deleted. If you misuse the system, we have the right to ban without warning. Do not spam in them either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>The more information, the better.</b> We can do research to try and figure out what you're talking about, but if you just say "it is stolen" and the save reported is not well known, the report will probably be ignored. Include the ID of the original save in reports, the author of the original and ID of the save being reported are not needed. If you do not know the original ID, you can try including the author's name, but if you have trouble finding it, chances are the moderator reading it also will, and will ignore it.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not ask for saves to be removed from the front page.</b> It might not be good, or maybe you do not think it belongs there, but you don ot need to report every bad save, or every art save, that ever gets onto the front page. They will be removed eventually if they do not deserve to be there, but a report will not get anything removed. If you do not like it, try voting it off instead.</li>
        </ol>

      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not include your powder.pref file if you post a mod.</b> Any smart person can take this file and login as you in an instant. The same applies even if you are not posting a mod. This has happened many times before on accident, and the results are never pretty. If we catch you posting something with this in it, the link will be deleted until you remove this file.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Always post the source code for your mod alongside the link to your mod.</b> Otherwise it will similarly be deleted, since no one can tell if there are viruses or other malicious code inside. This is because The Powder Toy is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL), this means that it is required by copyright law to release the complete source code for all public releases you make.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not upload viruses.</b> This should be obvious, but some people have constantly upload suspicious links with no source code, that seem to cause large annoyances to anyone who runs the program. If we cannot tell if it is a mod or not, the post will be removed, and you may be banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post mod announcements.</b> These are threads that announce a mod that will be released in a year or months from the thread. They may also ask for suggestions. Most of these never end up getting released for a few months, or ever, and just give false hope to the people who think it is real. If you want suggestions, there is the feedback forum, and a mod suggestion thread. You can post these threads if you have proof you have started (ex. Github commits, or a few elements made)</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post lua scripts or ask for help with lua scripts in Mods subforum.</b> No matter how much like a mod it is, it still belongs in the <a href="http://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Categories/Topics.html?Category=12" target="_top" class="shift-click">Lua scripting subforum</a>.</li>

      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Check if it has been sugested before.</b> Often people will suggest the exact same elements as others, without checking why the previous suggestion was rejected. Use the search bar on top of the forums and see what has been said about your element before suggesting it. You might get some new ideas and improve upon the previous suggestion. Also make sure it is not in the <a href="../#faq#rejected" target="_top">rejected element list</a>.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Consider if your element suggestion is even needed.</b> Does it do something existing elements already do? If it does not bring anything new or interesting to the game, Powder Toy probably does not need it and your element suggestion will be ignored.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Add in as many details and uses as you can.</b> A boring element with not many uses will probably be ignored. If you give lots of uses, more people will like it want it to be added. Do not just add in random uses though, they should all have a purpose.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Make sure your suggestion is not any of these things:</b><ul>
            <li>Copy and paste from another source like a wikipedia article.</li>
            <li>List of multiple unrelated elements.</li>
            <li>Moving solids or anything even closely related.</li>
