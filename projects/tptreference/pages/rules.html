      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Moderators may interpret these rules differently depending on each situation and common sense. Even if something is not directly listed in these rules, that does not mean you can get away with it.</p>
      <p>Read all of the rules about the activity you want to do before doing anything else. You are responsible for your account and ignorance is not an excuse.</p>

      <h3 id="forum" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#forum" target="_top">Forum Posting Rules</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Use proper grammar and spelling.</b> This helps others to understand you.<ul>
            <li>Avoid posting any curse words or foul language, censoring them <kbd>****</kbd> is fine.</li>
            <li>If you do not speak English, use Google Translate so that others can read what you say.</li>
            <li>Be polite, as trolling is a quick way to get threads locked.</li></ul>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not spam.</b> Major offenders will be temporarily banned.<ul>
            <li>If you do not have something useful to say, then do not post it at all.</li>
            <li>Double posting is prevented within a day due to a forum-wide software limitation on them.</li>
            <li>This also applies to bumping, which is when you post in an old thread in order to bump it back to the top of the most recent threads. This is only really allowed if your bumping post has something relevant to the topic, or a serious question is left unanswered in a help thread. Otherwise it is considered necroposting.</li>
            <li>Generally, try not to post in a thread more than a month old unless you have something useful to say.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Make your thread title descriptive.</b> If people do not know what is in a thread, they will never read it.<ul>
            <li>Avoid using all caps or unusual characters, they are painful to read. If we cannot figure what is in your thread from the title alone, do not be surprised if it gets locked.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not impersonate people.</b> Either with similar names, or using someone else's account. Expect to be banned if you do, there is not much tolerance for it here.<ul>
            <li>Multiple people using a single account specifically designed for that purpose is fine, as long as you don't post on the forums or break any rules with it.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post large images.</b> Many people still use slow internet, and large images will prevent them from reading your threads. If you want, post a hyperlink to the large image instead.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not make "+1" posts.</b> If you agree strongly enough then you can post why, otherwise do not post at all.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not talk about what mods are doing.</b><ul>
            <li>Conversation about people who have recently been banned tends to cause drama and spams threads with unrelated info to the original topic.</li>
            <li>If you do not know what they have done, ask a mod yourself using the Conversation feature.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not ask how to be a moderator.</b> There are no guidelines to follow for being made one, and the status is given for private reasons.<ul>
            <li>New moderators are rarely promoted, and will be handpicked by Simon if there is ever a need for more.</li>
            <li>If you do ask about it, the chances of being made a moderator become significantly smaller.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not advertise.</b> Either for other games, forums, programs or services outside of The Powder Toy here, we have enough activity dealing with just Powder Toy.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Piracy, is not tolerated.</b> This includes, but is not limited to, posting links to pirated software, links to piracy websites, or talking about it in general.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not be a back seat moderator.</b> Defined as a user who acts like a moderator, but does not hold an actual spot as one.<ul>
            <li>This gets very annoying, and only a real moderator knows which rules to enforce properly at which times.</li>
            <li>Calling "necro" in a thread may even get you banned. Do not ask for threads to be locked either unless they are yours.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not be a troll.</b> Trolls are just very annoying for everyone to deal with, and you will be more likely banned than others that follow the rules more often. This includes trolling anywhere, or in any thread, group or PM.</li>

      <h3 id="save" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#save" target="_top">Save Uploading Rules</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>No image plotting.</b> If you have to use a program to draw out pixels from an image outside of Powder Toy without drawing it by hand, then do not be surprised when the save gets deleted and you get banned. Jojobond has his on the topmost votes because he was the first to figure out how, but the grandfather rule no longer applies.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>No self-voting.</b> This equates making more than one account, and then using those accounts to vote for your own saves, or even someone else's. It is very obvious when it happens, we can see this easily. People get banned for doing this. Do not do it. It is still possible to make an account for multiple people to use and post saves on, provided no votes are made with the group account, and no posts are made on the forums with it.<ul>
            <li>As an extra precaution, we must warn you and your family members to not vote on the same saves. We cannot independently verify family members' votes</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>No hate saves.</b> So no shooting Jews, killing Bieber, etc.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>No penis drawings.</b> Or any other explicit or non-explicit sex please. We like to think this is a game that people can play with their family around. Do not post anything too inappropriate.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not ask for votes.</b> If your stuff is awesome, you should not have to beg for popularity to get votes. People tend to downvote when they see a lot of this anyway, it is not effective. Do not have anything relating to or mentioning votes inside the actual save<ul>
            <li>This includes saves that have the characteristic green arrow asking for votes, or a large number of signs mentioning votes in the save. If you want to thank people for the votes they have given, that can be a small note in the description or comments, but don't make it excessive either. Testing this rule to see how much you can do is a bad idea, because every moderator enforces it just slightly differently.</li>
            <li>Gimmicks for getting votes like "100 votes and I will make a better version" are similarly frowned upon. Vote farming will not be tolerated at all. Asking for votes in return for anything like save improvements or copying part of the save counts as vote farming. View farming or any other type of farming that may arise later is also still against the rules.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Keep the number of logos and signs to a minimum.</b> They not only slow the game down, but can also make saves unappealing for people to use. Saves that contain excessive numbers of Logos will be removed from the front page or even unpublished.<ul>
            <li>You can link to as many directly related saves as you want, but if you link to more then 3 unrelated saves, this is just too much advertising, and it will probably be removed from the front page.</li>
            <li>Do not make fake update or similar fake notification signs either.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not swear excessively.</b> Saves containing excessive swearing or rude language will be unpublished. Do not make rude or offensive comments either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not make text-only saves.</b> Saves are much better when they actually use some of the features in the game. Text-only saves will be removed from the front page should they ever get there.<ul>
            <li>Also, any element suggestion save will be removed from the front page. It is recommended that you make a thread on the forum, so it is more official and you can get actual criticism from developers and other users. You can make the save and link to it on the thread if you want.</li>
            <li>This also relates to art on the front page. Art saves that only rely on the deco layer are generally removed. Art using elements may stay longer if it is more impressive.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not claim others' work as your own.</b> If you did not make it, do not resave it for yourself, this is taking credit for something you did not make, and can take votes away from the original author. You can favorite a save instead of publishing a copy if you want to see it later.<ul>
            <li>This does not mean you cannot modify or improve saves though; building on the works of others is encouraged. If you give credit to the original author, it is usually okay to resave unless the author specifically prohibits it.</li></ul></li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not make laggy saves</b> If a save is so laggy that it crashes the game for some people, it's just really annoying. Saves that do make it to the front page that purposely lag the game will be demoted.</li>

      <h3 id="irc" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#irc" target="_top">IRC Rules</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Use common sense.</b> If it seems against the rules (trolling, spam, harassment, etc), it probably is, even if it is not listed here.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not flood or spam.</b> Pasting more than 4 lines of text at once is considered spam (consider using pastebin).</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post random quotes from other channels or websites</b>, unless it relates to the conversation. This can be seen as spam since nobody understands the context.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Please use legible English.</b> Purposely bad grammar, incorrect spelling, and slurs are highly annoying and will get you quickly banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not highlight random people for no reason</b>, or mass highlight the entire channel.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>#powder's only bot is PowderBot</b>, other bots are not allowed here and will be instantly banned. Bots can be brought to ##powder-bots instead. Do not use scripts without approval either, if you don't disable them you may be banned from the channel until you do.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not abuse or spam the bot</b>. Using the bot for excessive spam is against the rules and you will be given a channel ignore from the bot. Use the bot in PM instead, /query PowderBot.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not abuse caps lock or formatting characters.</b> These include colors, bold, underlines and right-to-left overrides.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post links to anything of illegal nature.</b> Shock and screamer sites are also banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post links to NSFW content or have explicit sexual discussions.</b> Excessive NSFW content is bannable, please use #powder-social when you can instead.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not complain about bans in channel.</b> If you need to resolve a ban, try querying the mod that placed it. Bans usually have expiration times but if you query the mod that placed it you might be able to get it removed quicker. If you complain and argue constantly over a ban in other channels, you might find yourself banned in those channels too.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Be nice to newbies.</b> Don't demand info like age, location (geoip), or tpt account, and don't troll or trick them into doing things.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not publicly log #powder or relay it to other channels without permission.</b> People do not expect what they are saying to be relayed to people they cannot see in other channels. There are currently official logs at <a href="http://mniip.com/irc/log/" target="_top" class="shift-click">mniip's Logs Page</a> though.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not rapidly change nicks.</b> Do not use nicks that encourage spam or trolling either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not impersonate other users from IRC or the forum.</b> Do not register other users' nicknames either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not talk about breaking other channel's rules.</b> We do not condone trolling or breaking rules in other channels</li>

      <h3 id="reporting" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#reporting" target="_top">Save Reporting Rules</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <p>Report a save for breaking any of the save uploading rules, it is not just for inappropriate saves and stolen saves. You may also report a save for the comments or tags on it, even if it is your own. This is the easiest way to notify a moderator of something they may need to delete. We can also see who creates tags, so if there is a large amount of tag spam, reporting may be better than deleting the tags yourself, losing the data of who made them.</p>
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not misuse reports.</b> It wastes moderators' time and may lead to saves wrongfully deleted. If you misuse the system, we have the right to ban without warning. Do not spam in them either.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>The more information, the better.</b> We can do research to try and figure out what you're talking about, but if you just say "it is stolen" and the save reported is not well known, the report will probably be ignored. Include the ID of the original save in reports, the author of the original and ID of the save being reported are not needed. If you do not know the original ID, you can try including the author's name, but if you have trouble finding it, chances are the moderator reading it also will, and will ignore it.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not ask for saves to be removed from the front page.</b> It might not be good, or maybe you do not think it belongs there, but you don ot need to report every bad save, or every art save, that ever gets onto the front page. They will be removed eventually if they do not deserve to be there, but a report will not get anything removed. If you do not like it, try voting it off instead.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3 id="modding" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#modding" target="_top">Modding Rules</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not include your powder.pref file if you post a mod.</b> Any smart person can take this file and login as you in an instant. The same applies even if you are not posting a mod. This has happened many times before on accident, and the results are never pretty. If we catch you posting something with this in it, the link will be deleted until you remove this file.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Always post the source code for your mod alongside the link to your mod.</b> Otherwise it will similarly be deleted, since no one can tell if there are viruses or other malicious code inside. This is because The Powder Toy is licensed under the GNU Public License (GPL), this means that it is required by copyright law to release the complete source code for all public releases you make.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not upload viruses.</b> This should be obvious, but some people have constantly upload suspicious links with no source code, that seem to cause large annoyances to anyone who runs the program. If we cannot tell if it is a mod or not, the post will be removed, and you may be banned.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post mod announcements.</b> These are threads that announce a mod that will be released in a year or months from the thread. They may also ask for suggestions. Most of these never end up getting released for a few months, or ever, and just give false hope to the people who think it is real. If you want suggestions, there is the feedback forum, and a mod suggestion thread. You can post these threads if you have proof you have started (ex. Github commits, or a few elements made)</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not post lua scripts or ask for help with lua scripts in Mods subforum.</b> No matter how much like a mod it is, it still belongs in the <a href="http://powdertoy.co.uk/Discussions/Categories/Topics.html?Category=12" target="_top" class="shift-click">Lua scripting subforum</a>.</li>

      <h3 id="suggesting" class="sub-topic"><a href="#rules#suggesting" target="_top">How to Suggest an Element</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <div class="well">
        <ol class="rules-list muted-list">
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Check if it has been sugested before.</b> Often people will suggest the exact same elements as others, without checking why the previous suggestion was rejected. Use the search bar on top of the forums and see what has been said about your element before suggesting it. You might get some new ideas and improve upon the previous suggestion. Also make sure it is not in the <a href="../#faq#rejected" target="_top">rejected element list</a>.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Consider if your element suggestion is even needed.</b> Does it do something existing elements already do? If it does not bring anything new or interesting to the game, Powder Toy probably does not need it and your element suggestion will be ignored.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Add in as many details and uses as you can.</b> A boring element with not many uses will probably be ignored. If you give lots of uses, more people will like it want it to be added. Do not just add in random uses though, they should all have a purpose.</li>
          <li class="text-muted"><b>Make sure your suggestion is not any of these things:</b><ul>
            <li>Copy and paste from another source like a wikipedia article.</li>
            <li>List of multiple unrelated elements.</li>
            <li>Moving solids or anything even closely related.</li>
            <li>Stickmen-related.</li></ul></li>
