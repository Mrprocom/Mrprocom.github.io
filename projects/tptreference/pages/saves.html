      <h2>Powder Toy Saves</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>After you have finished creating something in Powder Toy, you can save it either locally or online so that you can come back to it anytime. If you want to save it online, you can either make it public so that anyone can see it, or private so that only people who know the save ID can see it. Saving online requires signing in, but checking out other people's saves does not require signing in.</p>

      <hr>
      <p><b>Saving locally:</b> You can save your simulation locally by holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (only hold it if you are signed in) and then clicking the long white button that says "[Untitled Simulation]". This will open up a dialog box with a text field asking for the save name and a box under it with the thumbnail of the save. After entering a name and clicking "Save", your simulation will be saved on your computer in a folder named "Saves" and can be accessed anytime without having to have an Internet connection. To load saves stored locally, hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (only hold it if you are signed in) and then click the small white button in the bottom right corner. This will open a dialog box where you can search and browse through your local saves and load any of them.</p>
      <p><b>Saving Online:</b> You can save your simulation online by pressing the long button that says "[Untitled Simulation]", this will open up a dialog box with text fields asking for the save name and description, checkboxes for making the save published and paused on startup and a box with the thumbnail of the save. Public saves can be seen by anyone from the save browser. They can also rate it and comment on it. Private saves or unlisted saves are hidden from the public and can only be seen by you and anyone who knows your save ID. Note that this is why unpublished saves sometimes get a few views; those are from people who search for saves by ID.</p>

      <h3 id="updating" class="sub-topic"><a href="#saves#updating" target="_top">Updating Saves</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <p>You can update a save by clicking the update button next to the long save button. There is a 15 second cool down after each update or upload. If you update your save after 3 hours from when you first uploaded it, it will bump your save back to the first position in the recent saves section. You can keep doing that every 3 hours to make more users see it and possibly rate it.</p>

      <h3 id="browser" class="sub-topic"><a href="#saves#browser" target="_top">The Save Browser</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <p>You can access the save browser by pressing the small button in the bottom left corner. This is where you can search and browse saves made by the community. The first page you see is called the Front Page or FP. This lists the recent popular saves based on when they were first published and how many votes they received. The pages after that are sorted by the total number of votes.</p>
      <p>To see recently updated saves, click the "By votes" button in the top right corner to change it to "By date". Saves can be selected by clicking the upper right corner of their thumbnail. When you select a save, an action menu will appear at the bottom of the screen with actions to perform on the save. Clicking on the thumbnail allows you to preview the save and then open it. The preview screen shows the save thumbnail, title, description, votes and creation dates. On the right side, you will see the comments section. Commenting on a save requires signing in.</p>
      <p>To see your own saves, click the "My Own" button in the top right corner. To see your favourite saves, click the yellow star icon next to the search bar. You can add saves to your favourites list by clicking the "Fav" button when previewing them.</p>

      <h3 id="searching" class="sub-topic"><a href="#saves#searching" target="_top">Searching for Saves</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>To search for saves by title, use the search bar in the save browser.</li>
        <li>If you want to find a specific save by ID, type <kbd>id:</kbd> followed by the save ID. For example, if you want to search for the save with an ID of 2198, type <kbd>id:2198</kbd> in the search bar.</li>
        <li>If you want to search for saves made by a specific user, type <kbd>user:</kbd> followed by the username. For example, if you want to search for the saves made by Simon, type <kbd>user:simon</kbd> in the search bar.</li>
        <li>If you want to look at the history of a save (all the updates that were made to a save), type <kbd>history:</kbd> followed by the save ID. For example, if you want to look at the history of the Destroyable City 5 save, type <kbd>history:2198</kbd> in the search bar.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="fp" class="sub-topic"><a href="#saves#fp" target="_top">The Front Page</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <p>The Front Page or FP is the first page you see when you open the save browser. It contains 15 featured saves of the week. For a save to get to the Front Page, it must get voted up in a short period of time after it gets uploaded. A save can stay on the Front Page for up to a week. Afterwards, it gets automatically removed from the Front Page to allow other saves to take its place.</p>

      <h3 id="reporting" class="sub-topic"><a href="#saves#reporting" target="_top">Reporting Saves</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <p>If you see a save that violates the <a href="../#rules#save" target="_top">save uploading rules</a>, report it by pressing the "Report" button. This will open up a dialog box with small information on what you should report for and a text field where you can type your report. If you are reporting a save for being stolen, make sure to include the original's ID. You can report offensive comments or inappropriate tags by reporting the save in which those things are present, even if it is your own save. Sending a report will inform all moderators. They will try to solve the problem as soon as they can.</p>
