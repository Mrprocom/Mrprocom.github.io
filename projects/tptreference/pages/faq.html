      <h2>Tips and Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>This page covers some useful tips, answers to frequently asked questions and common problems.</p>

      <h3 id="tips" class="sub-topic"><a href="#faq#tips" target="_top">Tips</a></h3>
      <hr>
      <ul class="muted-list">
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Use the console to do quick calculations:</b> Since the console can be used as a Lua shell, you can use it to calculate numbers whenever you are taking measurements. Just open the console, write your calculation there (for example, 2 * (12^2 + 24) / 6 - 14), and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. It will give you the answer, which is 42 for that example. Use the asterisk sign <kbd>*</kbd> for multiplication.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Use "C" to set temperatures in Celsius:</b> If you want to set temperatures in Celsius using the PROP tool or using the console, you do not have to convert from Celsius to Kelvin; just add "C" at the end of your temperature value. Example: <kbd>!set temp dust 100C</kbd>.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not make laggy saves:</b> When you are making saves, make sure they look nice and not laggy; laggy saves are annoying to run, so users might not find them appealing.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Use deco:</b> Always use decoration and colours whenever possible because these are very attractive.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Give instructions using elements:</b> If you want to explain your save using text, write using elements instead of signs, preferably with an element that disappears over time, like BRAY. Use Lua scripts to help you write using elements like the <a href="https://starcatcher.us/scripts/#51" rel="nofollow" target="_top" class="shift-click">Texter</a> script.</li> 
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Learn from other saves:</b> If you find a complicated save and you do not know how it works, try to investigate it and learn the concepts behind it to improve your skills.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not report saves using comments:</b> If you find a save that breaks the rules, instead of talking about it in the comments, report the save without saying anything in the comments. This will inform the moderators and will prevent you from being harassed by the author.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Avoid conflicts:</b> If someone is harassing you in the comment section, ignore them and report the save they insulted you in. Moderators will delete the offensive comments and it will appear as if nothing major happened. They might even ban that user if they think it is well-deserved.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Store backups of your save:</b> Always keep backups of the save you are working on. Use stamps to save your progress for later or save it locally, which is better than saving it online; even if it is not published, some users can still search for saves using IDs, find yours and possibly steal it.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Take inspiration:</b> You can use Google Images for inspiration if you are having problems designing something.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Update or re-upload your decent saves:</b> If you think your save deserves getting to the Front Page, but is not receiving much attention, try updating it every 3 hours to get it to the first position in the recent saves tab (save bumping). You could even try removing it and re-uploading it later when more users are active.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Be friendly:</b> Be polite and respectful and always follow the rules so that you do not get banned and other do not harass you.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Check before asking or suggesting:</b> Before you ask a question or post a suggestion on the forum, make sure that it has not been suggested or asked before. You can check by searching it on the website using the search bar.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Know how to suggest elements:</b> When you post a suggestion to be added to the game, make sure to only mention one or more related features and list detailed information about them including how they can be useful.</li>
        <li class="text-muted"><b>Do not call it LUA:</b> "Lua" means "Moon" in Portuguese, so it is not an acronym and should not be written as LUA. This may sound stupid, but some people find it annoying and some will not take you or your knowledge in programming seriously if you do not write it correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Am I allowed to make multiple accounts?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Yes, although abusing multiple accounts for vote fraud or spam is against the rules, using multiple accounts to allow you to vote multiple times will result in a ban.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">How do I use Powder Toy behind a proxy?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>You can use the Powder Toy behind a proxy by specifying it at the command line, On Windows and Linux, this is simply a case of issuing the command:</p>
          <pre>powder-sse(2/3) proxy:&lt;address&gt;:&gt;port&gt;</pre>
          <p>where &lt;address&gt; is the address of the proxy and &lt;port&gt; is the port.<br>On a Mac, this is a bit more complicated, you must open a terminal and go to the directory with Powder.app in, and issue the command:</p>
          <pre>Powder.app/Contents/MacOS/powder-x proxy:&lt;address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</pre>
          <p>An example command would be:</p>
          <pre>powder.exe proxy:wwwcache.school.ac.uk:3128</pre>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">When I try to login, I get a "605 Timeout" error. How do I fix this?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>This error is very general. It means that the Powder Toy cannot communicate with the server, usually because there is no internet connection, or the port used (port 80) has been intentionally blocked by an administrator. If you are trying to use the Powder Toy from within a corporate or school network, it is likely you will need to use a proxy. Another known cause is Firewall or internet filtering software that runs on the computer, like Windows Live Family Safety, if this is the case, the relevant proxy settings need to be acquired, or the software disabled.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">I have registered on the website, but I cannot sign in.</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>If you are told your username or password is incorrect, it may be that you registered with a username that is not compatible with the Powder Toy. To keep usernames readable, only alpha-numeric, as well as hyphens <kbd>-</kbd> and underscores <kbd>_</kbd> characters are allowed in usernames, any other characters in your username are replaced with a hyphen <kbd>-</kbd>. Try using your adjusted username to sign in. Other common issues are:
          <ul>
            <li>Your password may have characters that you cannot correctly enter into the Powder Toy, in which case, you should change your password on the website in your profile.</li>
            <li>You may not have typed your username or password correctly (they are case sensitive).</li>
            <li>Another rare but possible issue is that the username or password is too long to be entered in the game login screen.</li>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">What is TPT and FP? and what is TPT++?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>TPT stands for The Powder Toy and FP stands for Front Page, which is the first page displayed in the game and on the website by default. Powder Toy was originally written in C, but now it is being rewritten in C++.</p></div>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">How do I become a moderator?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Better do not ask questions like that. Be a nice user, help others, make saves, program for TPT and maybe Simon will notice you.</p></div>

      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">My new avatar does not appear, how do I fix that?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>It takes some time for avatars to be updated. You can try emptying your browser's cache, if that does not work, then you will have to wait for about a day.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">How can I remove my account?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Sadly, you cannot remove your account because that would cause a lot of problems. What you can do is ask a moderator to hide all your posts, unpublish all your saves and permanently ban your account, but your account will still exist.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Someone is violating the rules, what should I do?</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>If you see anything that violates the rules, report it using the report button shown when you preview the save before opening it. Do not report using comments, moderators will not be able to see them. You can also report your own save if it has inappropriate or offensive tags or if something bad has happened in the comments section. If you are reporting a stolen save, make sure you mention the ID of the original save in your report.</p></div>

      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Magnetic effects on metals</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>It would require a new layer and some fancy magnetic field calculations, which is a lot of work, and we already have a lot of layers like pressure, velocity x and y, gravity, portals, wifi and more. Coding magnets and proper magnetic fields is also hard. Unless someone takes the initiative to do it, it is rejected.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Freezers and heaters that affect the temperature of particles in contact with it</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>There are already many ways to control the temperature of particles, like controlled reactions, using HSWC and using Game of Life elements. Static GOL elements like MAZE cool particles down and moving GOL elements like WALL heat particles up.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Movable solids that stay together, fall down due to gravity, rotate and bounce off other solids</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>It is very hard to code and the current engine does not support it. The best we can do is very glitchy and not what people want.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Element that glues powders together into solids</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>This is sort of like moving solids and is rejected for the same reasons.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Element that run Lua or console commands when sparked</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Other than being very exploitable, Lua commands could be dangerous and contain viruses because Lua allows OS related stuff to be done. It also causes speed issues; the commands need to be saved like signs, which would increase the size of saves, which is precisely why signs are limited. It would also be difficult to modify the code of the game without breaking so many saves that use those types of elements.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Element that gives particles it touches all of its properties</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>The reason why this suggestion is rejected is similar to why elements that run console or Lua commands when sparked are rejected; it might break a lot of saves if changes were made to the code. It also adds extra complication to the game that only very advanced users would understand and the element would break extremely easily.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Implementing sounds</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Particle simulators like TPT are not made in a way that would easily allow sound to work. All particles on the screen exist at once, so sound would have to come out of everything at one time. It is hard to imagine how every sound playing at once would work. Perhaps the best that can be done is some element that plays a note sound when sparked. Entire realistic sounds for a few random reactions would not sound good though.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">3D Powder Toy</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>It is hard to code and it would make the game extremely slow. It can be imagined as having many opened Powder Toy windows at the same time; the FPS count of that stack would be very low. However, 3D Powder Toy was added as an April Fools joke, but not the kind you would expect. If you open the options menu, you will see an option to change the depth of the 3D anaglyph effect. It is recommended to set it to 3 and use 3D glasses.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Anything related to stickmen</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Stickmen are not the main point of this game, and they are already very glitchy.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Bigger or resizable simulation sizes</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>It is not possible; the simulation has to be a fixed size and cannot be resized. If a larger size was needed, it would be required to distribute it as another executable or do some unwanted stuff. Saves would not be compatible between versions and some people can barely handle the size now. The number of pixels on the screen would change significantly if the dimensions of the simulation were changed, causing much more lag.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">More or unlimited signs</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>It is a bad idea to have unlimited signs. People are not supposed to make text-only saves, that is why they are limited. If you want to give instructions, you could draw them using elements, the best way to do so is to use a Lua script like <a href="https://starcatcher.us/scripts/#51" target="_top" rel="nofollow" class="shift-click">Texter</a>, which can be used to write down text using any element.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Smaller walls</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Walls are bad enough as they are in the code. Making them less than 4x4 would break things due to how the pressure and velocity grids use that spacing. You can use alternatives like DMND and FRME. TTAN can be used to block air pressure.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel panel-default clickable-panel">
        <div class="panel-heading"><h3 class="panel-title">Adding signatures to forum posts</h3></div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>Signatures are useless. They would make the forum less clean and organised and would make pages much longer since they take up some space. Sometimes they even become longer than the actual post itself. Profiles are already enough for sharing personal information and websites.</p></div>
